Platform as a Service (Paas)
----------------------------

### Start using environment configuration based on environment variables

Most Paas providers will expect your environment configuration to be based on environment variables, and Phundament 4's PaaS deployment scripts will activate this during the build/compile process in your PaaS provider.

Use an environment based configuration for your PaaS apps like described in the installation section.
