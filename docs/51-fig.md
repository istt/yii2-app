Docker containers with fig
-------------------------

> NOTE! This section is under development

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Linux) or [Boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io) (OS X, Windows)
- [fig](http://www.fig.sh)

### Get started!

[Download Phundament](https://github.com/phundament/app/tags) or clone:

    git clone https://github.com/phundament/app.git
    cd app

#### Initialize

Copy fig and Dotenv config to project root:

    cp .env-dist .env

You may edit the `.env` file to update environment parameters.

> Note: Values of ENV variables defined in `fig.yml` have precedence over `.env`.

To initialize your application run the following commands once:

> Note: If you are developing on OS X or Windows, make sure your host-vm is running in VirtualBox Manager or with `boot2docker start`.

    fig run web composer create-project --prefer-dist

They will make the `vendor` folder available in your project directory on your host machine.
And sets up the database, along with an admin user.


#### Run

    fig up -d web

#### Automated virtual hosts with Docker

To automatically create virtual hosts for your projects, you can use a combination of this [nginx-proxy](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jwilder/nginx-proxy/)
image and the [xip.io](http://xip.io) wildcard DNS service.

First, run the reverse-proxy container like described in its README, before you start web application containers.

```
docker pull jwilder/nginx-proxy
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock jwilder/nginx-proxy
```

This will automatically setup virtual hosts accessible through port 80 on your Docker host.
You should now be able to access the application under 

Linux

- [myapp-fig.127.0.0.1.xip.io](http://myapp-fig.127.0.0.1.xip.io)
- [myapp-fig.127.0.0.1.xip.io/admin](http://myapp-fig.127.0.0.1.xip.io/backend)

OS X, Windows

- [myapp-fig.192.168.59.103.xip.io](http://myapp-fig.192.168.59.103.xip.io)
- [myapp-fig.192.168.59.103.xip.io/admin](http://myapp-fig.192.168.59.103.xip.io/admin)

> On OS X the command `echo $DOCKER_HOST` should print the IP of your host VM, replace it with `192.168.59.103` in `fig.yml` and the URLs above, if neccessary.

You can display the application logs with:

```
fig logs
```

#### Accessing from other clients on the network

If you need to access the application in development from another client (eg. mobile devices), you can setup a port forwarding to your host-vm. This is an example how to add port forwarding to VirtualBox VM.
 
```
boot2docker stop
VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2docker-vm" --natpf1 "rproxy,tcp,,8001,,80"
boot2docker start
```

Make sure to update your `VIRTUAL_HOST` environment variable in `fig.yml`, replace `192.168.1.102` with the IP address of your machine.

```
VIRTUAL_HOST: myapp-fig.127.0.0.1.xip.io,myapp-fig.192.168.1.102.xip.io
```

and restart the containers with `fig up -d web`.

You can access the application under the following URL

```
http://myapp-fig.192.168.1.102.xip.io:8001
```

### Customize

You can replace the [Phundament 4 Docker container](https://github.com/phundament/app) with your custom base container.
